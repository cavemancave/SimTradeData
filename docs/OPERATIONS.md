# Data Quality Operations

Goal: improve data quality without putting heavy repair jobs on the daily
release path.

## Principles

- Daily jobs keep data fresh, complete, and publishable.
- Heavy quality repair jobs run separately from daily publishing.
- BaoStock-heavy jobs must not run in the default daily path.
- Every automated task must be listed in `ops/data-quality-tasks.yaml`.
- systemd templates live under `ops/systemd/` and match the YAML task names.
- Host-specific paths belong in `/etc/simtradedata.env`, not in unit files.
- Failed jobs do not loop forever; keep the last known-good release.

## Task Layers

| Task | Frequency | Publishes | Purpose |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `daily_cn_data` | Trading days 22:30 | Yes | Market, valuation, and status refresh; pre/post integrity; local or COS release |
| `weekly_cn_quality_repair` | Manual first, then Saturday 02:00 after validation | No | Historical quality repair for `bonus_ps`, exrights, and fundamentals |
| `monthly_cn_reconcile` | First Sunday monthly | No | Read-only quality report for long-term drift |
| `manual_cn_recovery` | Manual | As needed | Gap fill, rollback, or baseline rebuild |

## Daily Job

Example systemd checks:

```bash
systemctl status simtradedata-daily-cn.timer
systemctl status simtradedata-daily-cn.service
```

Service environment should explicitly set:

```text
SIMTRADE_DATA_DIR=/path/to/SimTradeData
MARKET=cn
PUBLISH_TARGETS=local
DOWNLOAD_ATTEMPTS=1
INTEGRITY_STRICT=1
```

For COS publishing, use `PUBLISH_TARGETS=cos` and provide the bucket, region,
key prefix, and credentials.

## Status Check

From the repository root:

```bash
python3 scripts/ops_status.py
```

The command prints task layer, systemd enabled/active state, and the next timer
time. On machines without systemd, it prints configuration status only.
Weekly repair and monthly reconcile templates are listed in YAML for tracking,
but should be enabled only after runtime and data-source pressure are acceptable.

## Daily Gate

Command from `ops/data-quality-tasks.yaml`:

```bash
MARKET=cn PUBLISH_TARGETS=local DOWNLOAD_ATTEMPTS=1 INTEGRITY_STRICT=1 bash scripts/run_daily.sh
```

Before publishing, the job must pass:

- DuckDB latest date exists.
- Active stock universe is not empty.
- Active stock market-data coverage is 100%.
- Active stock valuation coverage is 100%.
- Manifest version matches the DuckDB latest date.

## Weekly Repair

Purpose: improve historical quality without blocking daily publishing.

Typical work:

- `bonus_ps` precision correction.
- Exrights gap fill.
- Fundamentals gap fill or rebuild.

Run manually first. Add a timer only after runtime and data-source pressure are
known. After repair, produce integrity/report output; do not publish
automatically.

## Monthly Reconcile

Read-only task. If it finds problems, open a data-quality repair item; do not
mutate data from this task.

```bash
poetry run python scripts/check_integrity.py --market cn --strict --json-output logs/validation/monthly_cn_reconcile.json
```

## Failure Handling

- Daily job failure: do not publish; inspect latest `logs/daily/*.log` and
  integrity JSON.
- BaoStock-related failure: do not loop retries; wait for the next schedule or
  run a bounded manual repair.
- Bad published data: move manifest/latest pointer back to the previous version
  and keep logs for diagnosis.
